With your Arduino board, you can create new projects by using additional components such as circuit elements, motors, sensors, communication modules, etc. In order to assemble circuits using these components, we use a breadboard. Additionally, if you intend to use your Arduino more project-focused, there are "shields" available, which are pre-built circuits designed to be mounted on top of the Arduino board for the specific needs of your project.
During the learning phase, circuits are typically built on a breadboard. Connections with Arduino are established, and often, due to a common learning curve, the circuit may not work initially due to a connection error, which is a natural part of the learning process that can happen to anyone.
Especially for those who are new to learning Arduino, it can be difficult to understand whether the error is in the software or in the correct connection between the circuit components and the Arduino via the breadboard.

To address such problems, the Tinylab Arduino module has been designed. It features a single-board design or a socketed structure that can be easily assembled. This provides a practical usage method that prevents potential circuit assembly issues, offering a practical and portable prototyping platform.
