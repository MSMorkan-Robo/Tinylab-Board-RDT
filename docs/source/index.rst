TinyLab is an electronic board that contains commonly used components in prototyping. At its core, it features Arduino, enabling easy access to all the equipment needed for prototyping such as modules, circuit elements, sensors, etc., with Arduino codes.

With the recent update to mBlock 5.0, TinyLab now allows programming with Scratch-based programming. Scratch programming operates on a graphical programming logic developed for children who are new to coding. Its coding logic, which is quite different from other editor interfaces, allows users to code and execute functions they want to perform by dragging, dropping, and adding values to blocks, making it a fun and easy-to-learn editor.
